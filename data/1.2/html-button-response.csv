<p>Thanks for accepting our HIT! In this HIT, you will solve block
puzzles. There are 35 puzzles for you to solve.</p>

<p>On each round, you will see two sets of blocks. There are three places where you
can build a column of blocks. Your task is to stack the blocks in the left box
to match the blocks in the right box. The blocks
in the right box will always be in alphabetical order in the middle column.
You can only move the top block in each column.</p>

<p>Here's an example with 3 blocks:</p>

0,,,,,,18111.0,,"<h1 id=""points"">Points</h1>

<p>You will begin each round with some number of points. It costs 1 point to move a block.
If you lose all your points, they won't go below 0, but you still have to finish the round.</p>

<p>When a round is <span class=""Blockworld-highStakes"">High Stakes!</span>, every block
will cost 3 points to move, but you will also start with more points.</p>

<p>At the end of the HIT, we will convert the final points from each round into a bonus payment.
